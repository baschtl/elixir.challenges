# Anagram

Write a program that, given a word and a list of possible anagrams, selects the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Running tests

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)
