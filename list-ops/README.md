# List Ops

Implement basic list operations

In functional languages list operations like `length`, `map`, and
`reduce` are very common. Implement a series of basic list operations,
without using existing functions.

## Running tests

```bash
$ elixir bob_test.exs
```

(Replace `bob_test.exs` with the name of the test file.)
